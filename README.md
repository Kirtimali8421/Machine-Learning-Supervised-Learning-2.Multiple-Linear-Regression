# Machine-Learning: Supervised Learning: 2.Multiple Linear Regression
Python
📄 Description:
This project demonstrates how to perform Multiple Linear Regression using Python and scikit-learn. Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of simple linear regression where the prediction is based on two or more independent variables.

📊 Key Steps Covered:
Importing essential libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)

Loading and exploring the dataset

Handling input features and target variable

Splitting data into training and testing sets

Training the Multiple Linear Regression model

Making predictions on test data

Visualizing and evaluating the model performance (R² Score, MSE)

🎯 Objective:
To understand how to build and evaluate a regression model when there are multiple input features.
